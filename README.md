# NotExactlyEshop   
This is my project, which is written in pure PHP. It is a project that is supposed to represent an e-shop.

In the SQLdatab folder, a database can be found that can be imported into MySQL. Basically, a profile is created with the email testadmin@test.cz with the password 789789789. This profile is set to admin status, so you can edit, delete, add products.

The project contains Bootstrap v. 5.0, some pages have a visual page, but some do not.
